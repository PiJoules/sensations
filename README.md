# Feel the sensations
I sexually Identify as a dank meme. Ever since I was a young boy, I have always dreamed of being uploaded onto the imgur website and linked into the reddit threads. People say to me that a person being a meme is Impossible and I'm autistic, but I don't care, I already know I'm autistic. I'm having a computer scientist put my brain into my computer, equipping me with the dankest of pictures from the reddits. From now on I want you guys to call me "Sir Danks-a-lot" and respect my right to meme from above and meme needlessly. If you can't accept me you're a memephobe and need to check your internet privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.
